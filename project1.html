    <h1>Project 1 Details</h1>
    <p>The World Health Organization has identified antibiotic resistance as one of the most significant global threats to public health and food security. Antibiotics are excreted by humans and animals after administration, as well as being released from wastewater produced by pharmaceutical factories. Subsequently, these antibiotics find their way into rivers, causing adverse effects on the environment and wildlife. Research has established a link between antibiotic use and environmental antibiotic presence, contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance. Hence, it is imperative to have a practical method for detecting and quantifying antibiotics in both the environment and food.
Enrofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic commonly used in veterinary medicine, including poultry farming and fish treatment. Some recent studies have identified the presence of enrofloxacin in rivers, including those in the Pearl River Delta region and northern Poland. Enrofloxacin has also been detected in wild fish residing in these rivers, albeit in slightly lower concentrations. These findings suggest that enrofloxacin accumulates in wild fish, making them suitable organisms for bioaccumulation studies and monitoring of enrofloxacin. Additionally, since fish serves as a source of animal-derived food, establishing an efficient and rapid method for detecting antibiotics in fish can help prevent the consumption of antibiotic-contaminated food.
Among the various detection techniques available for quantifying enrofloxacin, mass spectrometry (LC-MS, MS/MS) is considered the most reliable due to its high sensitivity and selectivity. However, LC-MS comes with high instrumentation and maintenance costs, as well as the need for effective clean-up procedures for detection. Consequently, there is a demand for a simpler, more cost-effective, and sensitive detection method for enrofloxacin quantification.
In my research, I used Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) to detect and quantify enrofloxacin in fish muscle tissue. SERS is an optical detection technique known for its high sensitivity, as it relies on the distinctive "fingerprint" Raman spectrum. To enhance the signal, an Ag nanoparticle solution was utilized. SERS significantly simplifies and expedites the detection of antibiotics in the environment and food. Leveraging this straightforward and rapid detection method, governments can implement appropriate regulations, such as limiting antibiotic concentrations in drug factory effluents and restricting antibiotic in animal-derived foods.
